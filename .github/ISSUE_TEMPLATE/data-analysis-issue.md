*Please review https://roadcurvature.com/how-it-works/osm/ for details on road tagging issues in the map data. Do **not** submit issues to suggest edits in OSM -- you can edit OSM yourself. **Do** submit issues here where the OSM data appears accurate, but Curvature is/is-not highlighting the road as you would expect.*

**Describe what you are expecting to see/not see**


**Map URL that shows the road/segment in question**
